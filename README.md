# Fake News Detection from Data Flair

This is project is a simple fake news detection model that I am using to learn about Term Frequency Inverse Data Frequency and Passive Agressive Classifiers for text data mining. The model and data have been taken from a DataFlair [article](https://data-flair.training/blogs/advanced-python-project-detecting-fake-news/). The `extract.py` file is a script to unzip the data.
